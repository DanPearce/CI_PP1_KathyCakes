This Project is my first with Code Institute, and is here to showcase my knowledge in HTML and CSS. The name and inspiration for the project is from my good friend Kath, who in real life is an excellent baker. So this is what I imagined her 'real-life' bakery website would look like. 

The website is intended for people to get more information about the bakery and to also showcase some of "Kath"'s recipes. The site is designed with ease in mind and should be easily accessible to all.
