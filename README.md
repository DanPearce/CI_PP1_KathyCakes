## Design 

### Structure
I wanted the structure of the site to be easy to navigate with clear headings and sections to split the pages up while also staying consistent with design. The website has a total of 11 pages 4 of which you have access to at all times using the navigation bar, 6 which are recipe pages and a 404 page.

#### Nav Bar Pages
These pages are what I would consider to be the 'most popular' pages, they include key information about the bakery.
- 'KathyCakes' index.html to provide about us information and featured recipes.
- recipes.html to provide a place to find all recipes featured on the site.
- find.html to provide a page to give location information for the bakery.
- contact.html to provide a page for customers to get in touch with KathyCakes.

#### Recipe Pages, Individual
The 6 individual recipe pages are each unique and provide information that is specifically for each recipe. They all include a detailed image and instructions on how to make each peice.

#### 404 Page
This page has been implemented to provide a fall back in case of input error to ensure the user can remain on the site easily.

### Colour
The initial styling of colour comes from the header hero image of which the color #3c4044 can be found amongst the background in some variation. I thought this would be a great color to use as it's a charcoal grey which falls easily on the eyes. I also decided to go with #ecedf4 as the off white to counter balance this colour. These two colours are used throughout the site and stay consistent with the theme. 

I used WEBAIM.org to test the contrast of the two colors.
