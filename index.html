                <p>Here at KathyCakes we strive to provide our customers with the best cakes and recipes you can find in store and online! That's why all our baking goods are home-made and use only the best sources for ingredients. Organic and home-made is in our core so you’re guaranteed a delicious and succulent dessert to make you want to come back for more! 
                </p>
                <p>We’re often asked where we started and how we got our name! KathyCakes was founded in Bristol, UK in the early 2000s and is inspired from our Head Chef and CEO Kath! She used to bring cakes into her old job to share with her colleagues when she realised, she had the potential to start her own business as they tasted so good! All her colleagues used to love it when she’d bring some tasty treats to share! The positive feedback she received gave her the courage to break free and start her own bakery!</p>
                <p>Now running for over 10 years KathyCakes is a staple of Bristolian life and sets the bar high when in the search for baked goodness! So why not stop on by, <a href="find.html">come on in</a> and grab yourself a treat!</p>
